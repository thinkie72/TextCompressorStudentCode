| November 22 | 1:10-1:45pm | I thought a lot about different ways to approach this problem. First I tried to reverse-engineer your rates, which didn't provide much service. I then thought of decreasing bit lengths for each char, but that alone didn't have a very large compression ratio... |
| December 3  | 11-11:55am  |                                                     I started my initial implementation using the 15 most common words in Shakespearean works, and alice for alice in wonderland. I'll get to work on implementing the rest. This will probably work fine for now... |
| December 4  |  9:30-11pm  |                                                                                                     I tried this attempt, but ultimately failed. I think my logic is wrong somewhere, likely in the StringBuilder portion. Excited to learn a better way tomorrow... |
| December 6  |    2-3pm    |                                 I mostly completed the implementatin of expand using the pseudocode provided. I still have a little ways to go because of a index out of bounds error. I'm pretty close to finishing thi part, so I'll get to work on expand soon... |
